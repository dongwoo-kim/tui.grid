## Collect statistics on the use of open source

Vue Wrapper of TOAST UI Grid applies Google Analytics (GA) to collect statistics on the use of open source, in order to identify how widely TOAST UI Grid is used throughout the world. It also serves as important index to determine the future course of projects. location.hostname (e.g. > â€œui.toast.com") is to be collected and the sole purpose is nothing but to measure statistics on the usage. To disable GA, include tui-code-snippet.js and then immediately write the options as follows:
```js
tui.usageStatistics = false;
```

## ðŸ’¾ Install

### Using npm

```sh
npm install --save @toast-ui/vue-grid
```

### Via Contents Delivery Network (CDN)

TOAST UI products are available over the CDN powered by [TOAST Cloud](https://www.toast.com).

You can use the CDN as below.

```html
<script src="https://uicdn.toast.com/toast-ui.vue-grid/latest/vue-grid.js"></script>
```

## ðŸ”¡ Usage

### Load

* Using namespace

    ```js
    var Grid = toastui.Grid;
    ```

* Using module

    ```js
    // es modules
    import Grid from '@toast-ui/vue-grid'
    // commonjs require
    var Grid = require('@toast-ui/vue-grid');
    ```

* Using `<script>`
  
    If you just add javascript file to your html, you use CDN or `vue-grid.js` downloaded. Insert `vue-grid.js` with `vue` in your html like this:
    
    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
    <script src="path/to/vue-grid.js"></script>
    ```

* Using only Vue wrapper component (Single File Component)

    `vue-grid.js` has all of the tui.grid. If you only need vue wrapper component, you can use `@toast-ui/vue-grid/src/Grid.vue` like this:

    ```js
    import Grid from '@toast-ui/vue-chart/src/Grid.vue'
    ```

### Implement

First insert `<grid>` in the template or html. `rowData` and `columnData` props are required.

```html
<grid :rowData="rows" :columnData="columns" />
```

Load grid component and then add it to the `components` in your component or Vue instance.

```js
import Grid from '@toast-ui/vue-grid'

export default {
    components: {
        'grid': Grid
    },
    data() {
        return {
            rows: [ // for rowData prop
                {
                    name: 'Beautiful Lies',
                    artist: 'Birdy'
                },
                {
                    name: 'X',
                    artist: 'Ed Sheeran'
                }
            ],
            columns: [ // for columnData prop
                {
                    title: 'Name',
                    name: 'name',
                },
                {
                    title: 'Artist',
                    name: 'artist'
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Props

You can use `rowData`, `columnData`, `options`, `theme` and `language` props. Example of each props is in the [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md#props).

* `rowData`, `columnData`

    | Type | Required |

    | --- | --- |
    | Strinf or Object | X |

    This prop can change theme of the chart. We support `default`, `striped` and `clean` themes. So in case you just set `String` of these themes.

    If you want to use other theme, you set `Object` that is required `name` and `value`. For more information which properties of `value` are available, see `extOptions` of [applyTheme of tui.grid](https://nhnent.github.io/tui.grid/api/Grid.html#.applyTheme).

* `language`

    | Type | Required |

### Method

For use method, first you need to assign `ref` attribute of element like this:

```html
<grid ref="tuiGrid" :rowData="rows" :columnData="columns"/>
```

After then you can use methods through `this.$refs`. We provide `getRootElement` and `invoke` methods.

* `getRootElement`

    You can get root element of grid using this method.

    ```js
    this.$refs.tuiGrid.getRootElement();
    ```

* `invoke`

    If you want to more manipulate the Grid, you can use `invoke` method to call the method of tui.grid. First argument of `invoke` is name of the method and second argument is parameters of the method. To find out what kind of methods are available, see [method of tui.grid](http://nhnent.github.io/tui.grid/api/Grid.html).

    ```js
    const info = this.$refs.tuiGrid.invoke('getFocusedCell');
    this.$refs.tuiGrid.invoke('setWidth', 500);
    ```
